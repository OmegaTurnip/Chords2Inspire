          Hi, to accompany this article I also made a complete, free guitar and bass tab for this song. 
          It is a TuxGuitar 1.2 file so you'll need to download the tablature app to access it. 
          Enjoy!

        <hr>
        The hit J-Pop single by Keina 'Balloon' Suda took the internet music scene by storm
        when it was released in 2017, racking up to over 84 million views on Youtube and becoming
        one of the most famous Vocaloid songs in history. From becoming a staple song in most typical
        karaoke sessions, to being covered by thousands of musicians on the internet, you might wonder about what
        makes this song so <em>catchy</em>? Well lucky for you, I'm here to break it down, and analyse why this song has become a 
        timeless masterpiece.
        <hr>
        The song first starts off with its ever-iconic chord riff, set in the key of G minor/Bb Major (this key is different for Keina Suda's self-cover, as it's been pitch-corrected to serve his vocal range).
        The riff arpeggiates through the chords Eb Major, D Minor, G minor and Bb Major. This can also
        be written as a IV-iii-vi-I progression in Bb Major. The IV chord is used at the start to immediately introduce a bit of
        tension, but rather than resolving to the I chord as it would in a typical plagal cadence, it moves to the iii chord instead.
        This type of movement is relatively unique and pleasing to the ears as it's a half-step movement down, however the minor sound of the iii chord
        then introduces the melancholic quality in the progression. This iii chord then moves to the vi chord, creating a bit more
        resolution as the relationship between the iii-vi chord is very similar to the III-vi progression, which is a sub-dominant
        movement, however it still retains its regretful quality. Finally, it resolves to the tonic I chord, creating a hopeful twist at the end before returning to the unsure IV chord.
        <hr>
        This harmony is very interesting when analysed alongside the lyrics that the character in the song is singing. At first glance the lyrics seem to 
        describe a regretful situation between two lovers who have broken apart, or between two people close enough to use a word as strong as 'love' to describe
        their feelings for each other. 
        <hr>
        'You were the one who bid farewell, 
        <br>
        yet tears ran down your cheeks.' 
        <hr> The movement of the IV-iii describes the melancholy of saying goodbye to someone you loved (and may or may not still love).
        It can be interpreted that the character bidding farewell was the one to choose to break apart from the singer, but there is a contradiction as they are the one
        portraying the most sadness in the situation. Typically, when a farewell of this kind is done, people tend to want to leave things on a good note, and clear
        up their feelings as best as they can. This theme is signified by the major sound of the IV chord: an attempt at creating a happy resolution.
        However as we know, the chord resolves to the iii rather than the I, signifying melancholy and a divergence of expectations as the character the singer is talking to
        bids farewell with tears in their eyes. It is an expression of confusion and regret; what should have been a fulfilling goodbye has now turned into 
        a more complicated, sorrowful ending.
        <hr>
        'If you're going to erase the past like this, then this is enough.
        <br>
        Just smile.'
        <hr>
        It can be interpreted that the loved one is showing remorse for breaking the character's heart. The character may feel disdain for 
        being pitied by the very person who has caused their heartbreak, signified by the vi chord, and repudiates the loved one's feelings for a sake of a proper resolution. The iii-vi movement provides a soft but not complete attempt at a resolution, perhaps interrupted by the loved one's unexpected feelings. 
        The I chord resolution however, seeks to put this situation to an end, as if erasing the past melancholic chords with a solid, happier conclusion, using the words 'Just smile.' Indeed, words have been said that cannot be taken back, and the two characters must move on.
        <hr>
        The main instrumentation in the song is characterised by spanky guitars, powerful drums, a very melodic bassline and a 
        diverse range of synthesiser sounds, all built over the foundation of the intro chord riff. After the lead and verse section, we move quickly into the pre-chorus with a striking smash of a gong and a quick drum fill,
        introducing a gliding portamento synthesiser melody and a change in the chord progression. The progression goes: IV-vi-IV-III-I-IV-vi-IV-vi, IV-vi-IV-III, then IV-V right before it enters into the refrain.
        This harmony is very striking as the chords hang around the IV and the vi mainly, causing it to go back and forth between tension and resolution quite quickly, which is why this pre-chorus section has an edgy feeling to it. Also note the use of the non-diatonic III rather than the iii chord,
        which gives the pre-chorus a bit of a harmonic minor flair as it uses the raised 7th note of the G Minor scale. This leading tone is useful when creating strong tension in the music, whilst also resolving strongly.
        <hr>
        Now we move onto the main course, the meat and potatoes if you will; the famous chorus! The chord progression goes:
        IV-V-vi-I, IV-III-vi-I, IV-V-III-vi, IV-V-III. This then repeats, ending at the IV-V-vi-V-I instead of the IV-V-III. This chord progression is really just a typical variant of something that you see in a lot
        of japanese pop music, namely the 'Royal Road Progression', which is played as IV-V-vi. If you listen to the bassline, you can get an idea of how the harmony mainly feels. The IV and V chords
        provide a lot of tension, as if the character in the song feels desperate to express his love, and yet the vi chord softly resolves the previous two chords with a beautifully sorrowful ending. There's a reason why this chord
        progression is so unanimously used in japanese music, as it fully carries the kind of bittersweet, melancholic feeling that most people tend to cry to. It's a perfect example of a <em>sad</em> chord progression that mostly uses major chords, which allows it 
        to not come off as cheesy in the way it portrays its sadness. Really, it's more of a hopeful or nostalgic sort of sadness in that sense rather than a grieving one. It's a progression for sad songs with a nostalgic feeling, or lighter songs with a melancholic twist.
        <hr>
        We also again see the use of the III chord, which resolves strongly to the sorrowful vi chord. As if the character had some hope in the expression of their words (signified by the major sound and leading F# note in the III), only to realise it was all futile
        in the end (using the imagery of thick clouds in the lyrics). Finally, the chord progression ends with a I chord, accompanied by the lyrics 'We laugh together as we say goodbye'. A hopeful ending to an otherwise tragic refrain; we are told that at the end of it all,
        this regretful story can still have a happy ending... Unless..?
        <hr>
        In my opinion, the most important characteristic of this chorus is its vocal melody, let me tell you why. It is said that the most important thing in music is not the notes themselves, but the <em>space</em> between notes.
        One can think of this in a rhythm sense, which applies very well, however this is also true when thinking about the <em>intervals</em> between notes. An interval such as a Major 2nd, for example is a rather low-tension interval, and can typically be used as a passing note. When 
        you create more distance in the intervals, however, the brain reacts more strongly at the change in pitch, which can be more striking and memorable. Memorable intervals in melodies can lead to catchier ones, naturally. So why am I talking about this? Well, to explain that, let us go back 
        a couple of years to 2010 and look at some earlier very famous vocaloid songs to get a better picture of what I'm talking about, namely 'World's End Dancehall' by wowaka. One of the most notable songs in vocaloid history, it is also characterised by one of the catchiest choruses in the vocaloid scene.
        Now, what technique do these two songs share? 
        <hr>
        The use of repeated, memorable intervals, of course!
        <hr>
        The song World's End Dancehall makes use of the repeated perfect fifth interval in its chorus to achieve its catchiness, and in fact popularised it in other songs for many years afterwards. Intervals like the perfect fifth are very pleasing
        to the ears as they resolve very nicely, and they are a bit of a large jump from the tonic note, creating more space and jumping out more towards our brains. An example of this is the beginning of the Star Wars theme, which I'd be hard pressed to find anyone who says that they don't find <em>that</em> memorable.
        With the song Charles, on the other hand, began a new style of refrain that instead made use of the repeated <em>octave</em> interval. The octave is perhaps the most interesting interval since not only does it have arguably the greatest resolution out of any other interval, <em>it's also
        literally just replaying the tonic note at a different pitch.</em> This sound creates that striking characteristic that you want with large interval jumps, but it also retains perfect resolution, strengthening the sound and making it very memorable. This use of the octave interval is often found in 
        lines created by bass players, who seek to highlight the root note of chords whilst also creating large intervalic movement. Now of course, the octave interval is not the <em>only</em> ingredient that makes the song catchy, however it <em>is</em> the most important, at least in my opinion.
        Why not look at an example? Take one of the most famous J-Pop/J-Rock songs in history, 'Ussewa' by Ado, a song that has racked up over an astounding 246 million views. Most people will say that the chorus is the most memorable part of that song (alongside the singer's godlike vocals of course), but listen to it yourself and ask, 'What do I notice?' That's right,
        the chorus is indeed characterised by the use of the repeated perfect 8th interval!
        <hr>
        'Surely, we understood that we were just deceiving eachother like idiots.'
        <hr>
        Finally, after a couple of verses, pre-choruses, choruses and a bridge section do we arrive at the end of the song. Note the progression of the lyrics,
        and the way the two characters have begun to realise the futility of their attempts at creating a happy ending. 'Always lost, but look‚Äîwe really can't change',
        perhaps this realisation is more wholesome after all. When the two characters admit both of their faults, they can come to terms with leaving their ideals behind‚Äîthe very ideals
        they both trampled on. Rather then clouding their minds as if everything is okay, adorning their words with a false love, it's better to let your true feelings out. 
        <hr>
        'Our words have been dirtied.'
        <hr>
        Indeed, perhaps even this sorrow has a meaning. As we come to the song's closing, we see a repeat of the chorus a few more times as the character sings into the clouds,
        and rather then ending on the I chord as we did before, we simply end it at the vi. A tragic ending, as it was meant to be. Seemingly, it feels as if there wasn't a true ending, that things have not
        been tied up properly after all. 
        <hr>
        But sometimes, a sad ending can be more fulfilling than a happy one.
